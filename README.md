ABStract : Abstract
Motivation: Bacillus subtilis is a key organism in industrial biotechnology for producing value-added products. This study enhances the metabolic model of B. subtilis by incorporating structural information, focusing on levan biosynthesis—a fructose polymer with applications in hydrogels, drug delivery, and wound healing. We employed structural systems biology to integrate known structural details into the B. subtilis metabolic pathway, creating a structure-annotated genome-scale metabolic model (GEM). 
Results: This manually curated model links proteins and reactions to PDB entries, providing structural perspectives previously overlooked in GEMs. We quantified structural coverage: 331/1250 reactions (26.5%) and 508 PDB structures mapped to 168 UniProt IDs, with focus coverage of sacB, sacC, sacX/Y, levD/E/F/G, and sacP. The structural layer does not alter stoichiometry or constraints unless explicitly parameterized. This structure-annotated resource enables systematic testing of phenotype predictions and design strategies. The structure-based metabolic model advances understanding of levan production and microbial metabolism, facilitating sustainable and efficient biotechnological processes for industrial applications.
